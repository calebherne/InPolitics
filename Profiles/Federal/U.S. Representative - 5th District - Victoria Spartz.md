## Immigration Stance
**Complex - Personal immigrant story but no clear policy positions documented**

Despite being a **first-generation immigrant from Ukraine** who came to U.S. in 2000 and became citizen in 2006, Spartz has **not taken prominent public positions on immigration policy**. Her personal narrative emphasizes legal immigration and opportunity.

**Personal Story:**
- Immigrated legally from post-Soviet Ukraine at age 22
- Met American husband Jason on train; married 2000
- Emphasizes "American Dream still exists" through legal immigration path

**Policy Positions:**
- No documented voting record or statements on comprehensive immigration reform
- No clear position on border security, DREAM Act, or other major immigration issues
- Serves on House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement (118th Congress)

**Note:** Unusual that first-generation immigrant in Congress has not articulated clear immigration policy positions. This may reflect:
- Focus on other policy priorities (Ukraine, healthcare, fiscal issues)
- Desire to avoid politically divisive issue
- Tea Party conservative base in Hamilton County expects restrictionist positions
