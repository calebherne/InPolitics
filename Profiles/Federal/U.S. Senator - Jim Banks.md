## Immigration Stance
**Restrictionist - Border security focus**

Banks has **criticized President Biden's immigration policy** and called for reinstating Trump-era policies. He has been a vocal opponent of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, arguing it could allow undocumented workers to join unions and diminish U.S. citizens' voting power in union matters. He proposed an amendment to prevent unions from recruiting undocumented workers (did not pass).
