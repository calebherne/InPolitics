# Precinct Committeeman (Republican Party)

## Overview
Precinct Committeeman is often called "the most powerful position in politics" because it is the foundation of the Republican Party structure. Precinct committeemen are elected by Republican voters in each precinct and collectively control the party from the ground up. They elect county, district, and state party leadership and serve as the direct link between voters and the party.

## Requirements

- Must reside in the precinct being represented
- Must have voted in the most recent Republican primary election (in most cases)
- Must file candidate paperwork by the filing deadline (typically early February of election years)
- Age requirement: 18 years old
- No citizenship requirements beyond voter eligibility

## How Elected
- Elected by Republican voters in the precinct during the Republican primary election
- Elections held every four years (in presidential election years)
- Voters in each precinct can vote for one precinct committeeman
- Write-in votes allowed in many precincts
- If no candidate files, the position can be filled by appointment by County Party Chair
- Term begins after the primary election

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Grassroots Organizing**: Build relationships with Republican voters in the precinct

- **Hold Officials Accountable**: Use position to influence party direction and hold elected officials accountable to Republican principles

**Time Commitment**: Flexible volunteer position (typically unpaid)
- As much or as little time as the committeeman chooses to invest
- Minimum: Attend county caucuses and committee meetings (quarterly or as called)
- Active PCs: Regular door-knocking, voter contact, event attendance
- Peak activity: Primary and general election seasons

## Powers and Limitations
### Powers:
- **Elect County Leadership**: Vote to elect County Party Chair and other county officers

  - County party budget and expenditures
  - County party rules and bylaws
  - Endorsements (if allowed by county bylaws)
  - Filling vacancies in some local offices
- **Direct Access to Voters**: Only party position with direct voter mandate in precinct
- **Hold Leadership Accountable**: Can vote to remove county leadership or refuse to re-elect ineffective leaders
- **Shape Party Direction**: Collectively determine party priorities and platform through delegate elections

### Limitations:
- Authority primarily within party structure, not government
- Cannot dictate to elected officials how to vote or govern
- One vote in county caucuses and committee meetings
- Cannot unilaterally change party rules (requires committee vote)
- Position is volunteer with no direct government power

### Rarely Used Powers:
- Can propose changes to county party rules and bylaws

## Term Length
- 4-year term
- Elections held in presidential election years (2024, 2028, 2032, etc.)
- No term limits
- Can be re-elected indefinitely
- Automatic vacancy if committeeman moves out of precinct or changes party registration

## Why This Position Matters
The Indiana PC Project emphasizes that precinct committeemen are the "foundation of the party" with power to:
- Change the party from within
- Hold politicians accountable to their campaign promises
- Ensure elected officials uphold the party platform
- Control who leads the party at county, district, and state levels

Many precincts have vacant precinct committeeman positions, meaning a small number of committed activists can have outsized influence on party direction.

## Hamilton County Current Office Holders
Hundreds of precinct committeemen across Hamilton County's nine townships and numerous precincts. Many positions remain vacant or unfilled.
